| File Name | Domain Count | Description | Update Frequency | Raw Link |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| whitelist.txt | <!-- WHITELIST_COUNT -->191 | This file contain domains that are __safe__ to whitelist i.e. it does not contain any tracking or advertising sites. Adding this file fixes many problems like YouTube watch history, videos on news sites and so on. If you want to report additional domain feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/GoodnessJSON/PiHole-Whitelist/issues). | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoodnessJSON/PiHole-Whitelist/master/lists/whitelist.txt) |
| referral-sites.txt | <!-- REFERRAL_SITES_COUNT -->77 | People who use services like Slickdeals and Fatwallet needs a few sites (most of  them are either trackers or ads) to be whitelisted to work properly. This file contains some analytics and ad serving sites like __doubleclick.net__ and others. __If you don't know what these services are, stay away from this list.__ | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoodnessJSON/PiHole-Whitelist/master/lists/referral-sites.txt) |
| optional-list.txt | <!-- OPTIONAL_LIST_COUNT -->144 | This file contain domains that are needed to be whitelisted depending on the service you use. It may contain some tracking site but sometimes it's necessary to add bad domains to make a few services to work. Currently there is no script for this list, you have to add domains manually to your Pi-Hole. | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoodnessJSON/PiHole-Whitelist/master/lists/optional-list.txt) |

## <ins>How do I determine an ad domain?</ins>
- __Using PiHole:__ <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-determine-what-domain-an-ad-is-coming-from/1522">Follow the official PiHole instructions</a> for identifying a problematic domain.
- __Adam:ONE Assistant (formerly DNSthingy Assistant):__ <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adamone-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.
- __Using inbuilt Developer tool:__ For Chrome and Firefox, __`ctrl+shift+I`__ will land you in Developer tools menu.
- __Using an Android app:__ [__`Net Guard`__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard) is an Android app that can be used to monitor any specific apps, works on unrooted devices too.
